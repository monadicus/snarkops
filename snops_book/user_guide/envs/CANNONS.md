# Cannons

The cannon document is an optional where you can specify:

- where to source transactions from (ahead-of-time generated file or generate in realtime)
- what kinds of transactions to generate
- where to send transactions (to a file, or a node in the topology)


The cannon document is not required for a `environment` to run, but the document needs to be present at `apply` time to work.

This document is required if you want to use a [cannon timeline action](TIMELINES.md#cannon).

You can have more than one cannon per `environment`.

## Fields

The different top level fields you can specify in a cannon document and what they mean. You can skip to examples by clicking [here](#examples).

The required fields are italicized.

### _version_

The version of the cannon document.

### _name_

The name of the cannon document.

This is so you can refer to this cannon in other documents.

### description

The optional description for a cannon document.

### _source_

Where the transactions should come from.

#### query

Sets the query service for the cannon to use.

Has two modes local ledger or a node in the `environment`.
Optional defaults to the local ledger.

##### local

An optional field that if provided uses the node in the `environment` specified to sync from.

Defaults to `None`, i.e. agent uses it's own local ledger as is.

```yaml
source:
  query:
    sync-from: client/1 # optional
```

##### node

An optional field that if provided uses the node in the `environment` specified pulls that node's state root over RPC.

```yaml
source:
  query: client/1 # required
```

#### compute

Sets the compute service for the cannon to use.

Has two modes agent or demox.
Optional defaults to the agent.

##### agent

This tells the cannon to use agents in the `environment`.

You can optionally provide a list of agent labels to specify which agents to use.

```yaml
source:
  compute:
    labels: foo,bar
```

##### demox

This tells the cannon to use Demox's API to generate the executions.

Requires the url for the API.

```yaml
source:
  compute:
    demox-api: https://exampleurl.com/api/v1
```

### _sink_

Sinks specify where transactions should go, and optionally how many
attempts should be made before timing out.

#### _file-name_

Specify a file to write transactions to. This will reside inside the environment's data directory under this name.

```yaml
sink:
  file-name: txs.json
```

The format of the file is:

```json
{tx_1_info...}
{tx_2_info...}
```

#### _target_

Specify the node target(s) the tx's should be fired at.

```yaml
sink:
  target: client/1
```

#### _broadcast-attempts_, _broadcast-timeout_, _authorize-attempts_, _authorize-timeout_

Options for configuring when to drop broadcast/authorization attempts.

The `broadcast-*` options are not relevant if `target` is not configured.

The `broadcast-timeout` and `authorize-timeout` options (seconds) start immediately after an attempt. A broadcast will not be re-broadcast/dropped until the next block occurs.

The `broadcast-attempts` and `authorize-attempts` are limitless when absent. A setting of 0 means a failure will not result in another attempt. A setting of 2 means two attempts will be made before dropping.

```yaml
sink:
  target: '*/*'
  broadcast-attempts: 3
  authorize-attempts: 3
  broadcast-timeout: 60 # 1 minute timeout on failure
  authorize-timeout: 60 # 1 minute timeout on failure
```

## Examples

A few different examples of topology docs.

### Record txs to a file

```yaml
---
kind: snops/cannon/v1

name: realtime-txs-record-to-file

source:
  query: "*/*" # node targets
  labels: [local] # compute labels

sink:
  file-name: txs.json

```

### Playback Fire Right Away
```yaml
---
kind: snops/cannon/v1

name: txs-from-file-to-target-node

source:
  # playback mode
  file-name: txs.json

sink:
  # realtime mode
  target: validator/test-1
  # 2 minute timeouts
  broadcast-timeout: 120
  authorize-timeout: 120
  # additionally record to a file
  file-name: out.json
```
