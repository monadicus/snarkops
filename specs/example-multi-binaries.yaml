  # providing a "default" binary will make agents download a binary different than the one configured by
  # the AOT_BIN env
  default:
    source: ./path/to/example_file
    # for path based sources, "auto" can be specified for sha256 and size
    # to automatically compute them when the environment is applied
    #
    # This feature is also available for env via: `AOT_BIN_SIZE=auto` or `AOT_BIN_SHA256=auto`
    sha256: auto
    size: auto

  # providing a "compute" binary will make compute agents download it instead of the default
  # this is also an example of a short-hand syntax for the binary path
  compute: ./path/to/compute/file

  # providing a "http" binary will make agents download it from the provided URL
  example_http:
    source: https://example.com/example_file
    # sha256s are case insensitive and must be 64 characters long
    sha256: a95e329b13627165283e59c5435586d681fdbbe517f45e868178f9453cb55e72
    size: 123 # auto is not available for url sources

  # Use the shorthand syntax for http binaries at your own discretion as
  # the sha256sum is not verified by the agent or the control plane on download
